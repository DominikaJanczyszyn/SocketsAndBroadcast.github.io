# Workshops 5
<p>Hello everyone at the fifth session of Workshops!</p>

<p>Today we'll be focusing on Sockets and Broadcasting technologies for client/server systems.</p>

<p> Today you will have to modify the exercise from the second session of workshops, in the way, that it will change from single user system to client/server one.</p>

<p>The idea behind the system is to allow users to set their username, add a task and mark it as a in-progress one or done. It's very simple, but it will help you better understand basic concepts from SDJ2 so far.</p>

<p>The exercise consists of 15 steps. Let's get started.</p>
